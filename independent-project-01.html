      <p class="lead">Hey, did you know that <span id="changeColor" class="changeColor">Lorem Ipsum</span> has been the industry's standard dummy text ever since the 1500s? An unknown printer took a galley of type and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting, remaining essentially unchanged.</p>

    <h3>Where does this text even come from?</h3>
      <p class="lead">Contrary to popular belief, <span id="changeColor" class="changeColor">Lorem Ipsum</span> is not simply random text. It has roots in a piece of classical Latin literature from 45 BC, making it over 2000 years old. Lorem Ipsum comes from sections 1.10.32 and 1.10.33 of "de Finibus Bonorum et Malorum" (The Extremes of Good and Evil) by Cicero, written in 45 BC. This book is a treatise on the theory of ethics, very popular during the Renaissance.
