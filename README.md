## Setup/Installation Requirements

* Open index.html file in your favorite browser though it was designed for Chrome.

## Known Bugs

There is a row sorting issue when the page is minimized too far or on a mobile device. The rows collapse into columns and they are not sorted in order. Version 2.0 will fix this.
