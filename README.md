Independent Project 01
This is a solo project to demonstrate the concepts covered in the first week of class at Epicodus. It is a webpage about Lorem Ipsum.

Getting Started
You need some kind of text editor to look at the code. If you do not have a text editor the osx app Text Editor will do. Microsoft word should be fine for a Windows user. If using Linux I'm assuming you can handle this part.
You will need a web browser to look at the site.

Installing
Once you launch your web browser just drag and drop the html file into a window. It's that easy.

Running the tests
There isn't a lot of tests for this. It's pretty simple. I did run into some issues I didn't have time to fix when collapsing the page: the column list doesn't collapse in the correct order.
